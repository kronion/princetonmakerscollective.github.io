	<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
	<p>
		We're a group of Princeton students who love to build things and want to start
		building things together. While we're mostly engineering and science majors, we
		welcome anyone with a love for making! We hack at the eLab, where have a MakerBot,
		soldering irons, more fancy tools, and even more lorum ipsum.

		Join us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/makerscollective/">Facebook</a>.
